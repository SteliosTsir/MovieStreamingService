# Movie Streaming Service

This project was completed as part of an assignment in the Computer Science Department at the University of Crete. The assignment was for the course HY240 - Data Structures.

In this assignment, we were asked to develop a simplified movie streaming service. The service organizes movies into various thematic categories. 
Users can register, watch movies, add them to their viewing history, and perform filtered searches within the categories. 
To efficiently manage the data, data structures such as trees and a hash map were utilized.
